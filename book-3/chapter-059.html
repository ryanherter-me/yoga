<p>Chapter 59</p>
<p>Padma & Two Leelas Live Out Their Liberated Lives</p>
<p>1 Vasishta said:— “Be it so,” said Saraswati and disappeared into the air, and people awoke that morning with their king restored to life.</p>
<p>2 Padma embraced the reborn Leela, who embraced him in her turn. They were exceedingly glad in their coming to life again.</p>
<p>3 The palace was filled with loud shouts of joy like those of giddy revelry. Citizens were full of mirth and merry, song and music.</p>
<p>4 Shouts of victory and sounds of cheers and joys resounded in the air. People elated with joy thronged at the royal courtyard to see their king.</p>
<p>5 The spirits of the masters and demigod vidyadharas dropped flowers from above, and the sound of drums, kettles, trumpets and conches resounded on all sides.</p>
<p>6 Outside, elephants roared aloud with uplifted trunks. Crowds of women filled the inner courtyard with loud rejoicing.</p>
<p>7 Men bearing presents for the king fell upon one another at their mutual clashing. Others wearing flowery garlands on their heads and hairs moved gracefully all about.</p>
<p>8 Red turbans of joy on the heads of chiefs and a host of citizens, and the waving of the reddish palms of dancing girls, filled the sky with a bed of red lotuses.</p>
<p>9 The ground also was strewn with rosy flowers, by foot-falls of dancers with their reddish soles. The hanging earrings of ballet girls that flourished with the movement of their heads and shoulders waved in the air like flowers of gold.</p>
<p>10 Silken veils, like autumn clouds, covered the faces of fairy maidens in their dancing. They glittered like so many moons shining in the courtyard.</p>
<p>11 Then people retired to their respective homes with loud applause for the queen’s return with her husband from the other world.</p>
<p>12 King Padma heard of his adventures from the reports of his subjects, and made his purificatory ablution with the waters of the four seas of the earth.</p>
<p>13 Then royal ministers and ministerial brahmins joined together in the act of his installation, like a synod of immortals meeting at the inauguration of Indra.</p>
<p>14 The two Leelas continued in company with the king, describing with delight their respective adventures and the wisdom they had gathered thereby.</p>
<p>15 It was in this way that by grace of the genius of wisdom and their own experience, this King Padma and his two queens obtained prosperity equal to that of the three worlds.</p>
<p>16 The king, filled with the wisdom given to him by the goddess, in company with his consorts, continued to rule over his kingdom for thousands of years.</p>
<p>17 In their state of living liberation they reigned on earth for myriads of years. Then, receiving the perfect knowledge of the holy masters, they became wholly liberated after their deaths.</p>
<p>18 The happy pair having jointly reigned over their delightful realm of ever increasing population, and which was graced by learned men and righteous people, knowing their own rights and duties of doing good to all mankind, became freed from the burden of their state affairs forever.</p>
