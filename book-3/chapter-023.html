<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Saraswati & Leela Meditate & Begin Astral Travel</p>
<p>1 Vasishta said:— After this conversation between Goddess Saraswati and the excellent Leela on that night, the two of them found Leela’s family and attendants fast asleep in the inner apartment.</p>
<p>2 Saraswati and Leela entered the shrine that was closely shut on all sides by latches fastened to the doors and windows, and which was perfumed with the fragrance of heaps of flowers.</p>
<p>3 They sat beside the corpse decorated with fresh flowers and garments. Their faces shone like the fair full moon and brightened the place.</p>
<p>4 They stood motionless on the spot, as if they were sculptures engraved on marble columns, or pictures drawn upon the wall.</p>
<p>5 They shook off all their thoughts and cares, and became as withdrawn as the faded blossoms of the lotus at the end of the day when their fragrance has fled.</p>
<p>6 They remained still, calm and quiet and without any motion of their limbs, like a sheet of clouds hanging on the mountain top in the calm of autumn.</p>
<p>7 They continued in fixed attention without any external sensation, like some lonely vines shriveled for lack of moisture (in samadhi meditation).</p>
<p>8 They were fully impressed with the disbelief of their own existence, and that of all other things in the world. They were completely absorbed in the thought of an absolute privation of everything at large.</p>
<p>9 They lost memory of the phantom of the phenomenal world, which is as unreal as the horn of a hare.</p>
<p>10 What had no existence in the beginning is still non-existent at present, and what appears existent is as non-existent as water in a mirage.</p>
<p>11 The two ladies became as quiet as inert nature herself, and as still as the sky before the stars rolled about in its ample sphere.</p>
<p>12 Then they began to move with their own bodies, the goddess of wisdom in her form of intelligence and the queen in her intellectual and meditative mood.</p>
<p>13 With their new bodies they rose as high as the width of a hand above the ground, then taking the forms of empty consciousness, they began to rise in the sky.</p>
<p>14 Then the two ladies, their playful open eyes and by their nature of intellectual knowledge, ascended to the higher region of the sky.</p>
<p>15 They flew higher and higher by force of their intellect and arrived at a region stretching millions of miles in length.</p>
<p>16 The pair in their ethereal forms looked around according to their nature in search of some visible objects, but finding no other figure except their own, they became much more attached to each other by their mutual affection.</p>
